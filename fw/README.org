* Firmware for the ESP8266 board

- the project uses PlatformIO as configuration/build tool
- copy include/wifi.h.example to include/wifi.h and set your WPA SSID and password
- when you write the firmware you also need to copy the data partition.
  If you don't change the data/ folder it is required only once.
