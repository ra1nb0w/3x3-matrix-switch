The repository contains a project that I made in the 2020 after I was
frustrated to switch cables between radios and loads (antennas or
resistive load). It is a three by three matrix switch and it is mainly
designed for HF frequencies since it is a two layer PCB. In essence,
you can connect each of the three inputs to each of the three outputs
using a web interface (they are mutually exclusive). The web interface
permits to define a name for each port and it stores the connections.

** Folders

- *pcb*: contains the schematics, the BOM and the Gebers RS-274X;
- *case*: contains the two part of the 3D case that I use;
- *fw*: contains the firmware to load into the ESP8266. It uses the
  Arduino Framework and PlatformIO to manage the project. Read the
  README in the folder for more information.
